# multi_servo-thing #

a simple thing for the "Modular Things" project that controls up to 8 RC servos

> Nota bene: in contrast to the "things" provided by the "Modular Things" project itself, this one has been developed for a [Pimoroni Tiny2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tiny-2040) board (simply because I just had one on my desk). Since it uses the built-in RGB LEDs of that board, you may have to adjust the LED output commands in the Arduino "Firmware" shown below in order to make a thing for a different board.
